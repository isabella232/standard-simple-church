## 2.0 (January 1, 2013)

* It's a new year, so why not release an update!
* Moved the site to a new domain.
* Added extra spacing between posts to help set them apart visually.
* Fixed Blogroll link colors.
* Added CSS control for post font size and set it to 1em. "em" will match the user's default font size in his browser.
* Add "Widgets and Plugins" section to custom CSS file.
* Added CSS control for Intense Debate to hide comments on Pages and single Calendar events.
* Added CSS to hide post header (byline) and breadcrumbs from Event pages.
* Site is compatible with Standard 3.2 Beta as far as I can tell. Don't forget to change the Template and Iport settings if you're using the beta or when 3.2 officially releases. Unless something breaks, I won't be updating for 3.2 officially.
* Updated documentation.
* Cleaned up CSS.
